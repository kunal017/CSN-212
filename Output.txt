The Interval Tree for sample dataset is :

Low - 5, High - 20, Maximum = 20
Low - 10, High - 30, Maximum = 30
Low - 12, High - 15, Maximum = 15
Low - 15, High - 20, Maximum = 40
Low - 17, High - 19, Maximum = 40
Low - 30, High - 40, Maximum = 40

One more interval has been added to the tree.

Deleting the interval added in the end - [32,38]

Searching for interval 1 - [14,16]
Interval found and overlaps with [15, 20]

Searching for interval 2 - [21,23]
Interval found and overlaps with [10, 30]
